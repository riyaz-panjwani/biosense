## About Dataset
This Image dataset has been divided into train and val folders and into Biodegradable and non-biodegradable folders.<br>
<br>
Each category has 4 classes. For Biodegradable class:<br>
paper, leaf, food, wood<br>
<br>
For Non-Biodegradable class:<br>
waste, plastic bags, plastic bottles, metal cans<br>
<br>
To do:<br>
Train a classifier model to predict whether the image belongs to the Biodegradable or Non-Biodegradable class.<br>
You can use transfer learning or make your own Neural Network for the same.<br>
<br>
Machine Learning Model used : EfficientNetB3

The proposed application development project aims to classify biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste using Machine Learning and image recognition. By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, the system can accurately identify the type of waste in real-time, ensuring efficient waste management and disposal. The image recognition module analyses the visual features of the waste items. These data points contribute to the accurate classification of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. The ML model employed by the application is trained on a diverse dataset comprising examples of different waste items. Through supervised learning, the model learns to differentiate between various types of waste based on their visual characteristics. This enables the system to make informed decisions regarding waste disposal, routing biodegradable waste for composting or eco-friendly methods, and non-biodegradable waste for recycling or landfill disposal.<br>
